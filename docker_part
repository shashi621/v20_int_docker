1. In you CreditScore application application.properties file define serverport 8899 to prevent any possible conflicts.

2. You have to create Dockerfile in your project root directory:

========== code begin ==========
# Dockerfile

FROM openjdk:11
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/myapp/
COPY target/credit-score-app.jar /usr/src/myapp/
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["java" "jar" "credit-score-app.jar"]
========== code end  =========


3. Change the exact name of your application JAR file in the Dockerfile and the exact location from which it can be taken.
4. Create  YML file:

========== code begin ==========
version: '3.7'

services:

    credit-score-app:
        build:
          context: ./../path/to/your/application/root/directory
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        networks:
          - genesis_net
        ports:
          - "8899:8899"
        environment:
          EXTERNAL_IP: credit-score-app

networks:
    genesis_net:
        external:
            name: infra_genesis_net
========== code end  ==========

5. Now you can run:
docker-compose -f [your_yml_file_here] -p 3rd-party %*
